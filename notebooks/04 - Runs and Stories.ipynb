    "At this point, we've built a container class to store the output of `starlab` commands, but we have yet to create a pythonic way to generate those commands in the first place. We're going to do that now. This object (which we will call a `Run`) should contain all of the metadata for a simulation, methods to generate the necessary starlab commands and create `Stories` from them, and references to the resulting `Story` objects. It might be convenient to store `Stories` for all of the transformations that happen prior to integrating, as well.\n",

    "There are a couple of ways we could approach this task. We could:\n",

    "1. Make a very generic and flexible system for generating shell commands, or\n",
    "2. Make specific methods for the commands we will use.\n",

    "Thinking ahead to building the web frontend, I think option 2 will serve us better, so we'll go that route."
